# Sorting Algorithms in C

## Title
**Sorting Algorithms Implementation in C**

## Introduction
This repository focuses on implementing various sorting algorithms in C programming language. Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in organizing data efficiently, making it easier to search and retrieve information. By understanding and implementing these algorithms, developers can enhance their problem-solving skills and write more efficient code.

### Available Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: An in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist.
- **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort**: A divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them.
- **Quick Sort**: Another divide and conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot.
- **Heap Sort**: A comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to build a heap and then sorts it.

- [Merge Sort in C](./4-merge_sort.c)
- [Quick Sort in C](./5-quick_sort.c)

## Usage
Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate C file. To use a specific sorting algorithm, compile the corresponding C file using a C compiler such as GCC, and execute the generated executable.

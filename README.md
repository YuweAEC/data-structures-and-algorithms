## Introduction

**DSA stands for Data Structures and Algorithms**.
It is also sometimes referred to as **PSDS - Problem Solving Data Structures**. 

*DSA* is applied in *problem-solving* and enables developers to learn to write *efficient code*. The quality of the code can be judged by how much *memory* and *time it consumes*.

**Linear data structures** are data structures in which data elements are stored in a linear sequence. They include: Arrays: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. Linked Lists: A collection of nodes, each containing an element and a reference to the next node.

**Non Linear data and structures** is a form of data structure where the data elements don't stay arranged linearly or sequentially. Since the data structure is non-linear, it does not involve a single level. Therefore, a user can't traverse all of its elements in a single run.

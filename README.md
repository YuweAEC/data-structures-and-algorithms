## Title
**Problem Solving with Data Structures**

## Introduction
**DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)**, also known as **PSDS (Problem Solving Data Structures)**, is essential for writing efficient code. It involves organizing and managing data to solve complex problems effectively. This repository focuses on both linear and non-linear data structures to enhance problem-solving skills.

### Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures store elements sequentially, facilitating easy traversal. Examples include:
- **Arrays**: Elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Linked Lists**: Nodes containing elements and references to the next node.

### Non-Linear Data Structures
Non-linear data structures offer more complex arrangements, making traversal more challenging. These structures include trees, graphs, and hash tables.

**Sorting** is crucial for arranging data in preferred orders, facilitating efficient searching and retrieval.
